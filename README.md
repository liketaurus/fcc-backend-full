# Timestamp micro service
My code for freeCodeCamp back-end certification - first exercise (timestamp micro service)

Here are the specific user stories that was implemented in this project:
* I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
* If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
* If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
